# History

## 2026-05-18 — Testing coverage for validation and routers

- Added field validation unit tests for text constraints, optional values, email, number, date, rating, file URL validation, choice options, checkbox selections, and full-form schemas.
- Added tRPC caller-level integration tests covering protected auth rejection, public slug lookup, form creation, free-plan form limits, update input validation, field sort ordering, and field ownership failures.
- Marked the testing task complete and expanded the next error-handling task into a fresh-session implementation plan.

### Ship Manifest

- **User goal:** Execute the next incomplete `$run` step, which was the high-priority testing task.
- **Changed files:** `src/lib/__tests__/field-types.test.ts`, `src/server/trpc/routers/__tests__/integration.test.ts`, `tasks/todo.md`, `tasks/history.md`.
- **Per-file purpose:** `field-types.test.ts` validates field-level and form-level schemas; `integration.test.ts` exercises tRPC procedures through `appRouter.createCaller` with a narrow in-memory DB mock; `tasks/todo.md` records task completion and next-step details; `tasks/history.md` records the ship boundary.
- **User-goal mapping:** The new tests directly cover field validation logic and tRPC router behavior requested by the completed task.
- **Tests run:** `pnpm test` passed: 8 test files, 26 tests. `pnpm lint` passed.
- **Skipped tests:** `pnpm build` was attempted and compiled successfully, but prerendering failed because Clerk has no `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`/publishable key configured for the dashboard route. This is an environment blocker rather than a source or type failure.
- **Adversarial review:** Reviewed the new tests for false positives: field tests call real validators, and router tests call real tRPC procedures rather than static source checks. The DB mock is intentionally narrow and should not be reused as broad persistence proof.
- **Residual risk:** Router integration tests do not exercise real Drizzle SQL generation or a real Postgres database. They validate procedure wiring, auth middleware behavior, input parsing, and expected router decisions.
- **Rollback note:** Remove the two new test files and revert the two task-doc updates.
- **Next command:** `$run`
